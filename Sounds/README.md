# Sounds Folder

This folder is where you place your custom sound files for iSoundPlayer.

## How to Add Sounds

1. Place your `.mp3` or `.ogg` sound files in this folder
2. The sound files will be available in-game for use with iSoundPlayer triggers
3. Reference them in your triggers using the path: `Interface\\AddOns\\iSoundPlayer\\Sounds\\YourFileName.mp3`

## Supported Formats

- `.mp3` - MP3 audio files
- `.ogg` - OGG Vorbis audio files

## Example

If you add a file named `alert.mp3` to this folder, you can use it in iSoundPlayer by referencing:
```
Interface\AddOns\iSoundPlayer\Sounds\alert.mp3
```

## Tips

- Keep file names simple and without spaces
- Use descriptive names for easy identification
- Test sounds in-game after adding them
- Lower volume files work better to avoid sudden loud sounds
